# streamlit-reading-herodotus
This is a streamlit app that permits one to read Herodotus' histories side-by-side with the english translation, along with automatically generated hints for greek words. The histories were sourced from [grc_text_perseus](https://github.com/cltk/grc_text_perseus) and the hints come from 2 sources: [CLTK's](http://cltk.org/) NLP analysis and manual lookup from the [Perseus lexicon](https://github.com/cltk/greek_lexica_perseus). 

There are some mistakes in the hints, lemmas and definitions, but they become obvious when cross-checked against the english translation. 

The app is currently live at https://fedorst-streamlit-reading-herodotus-streamlit-app-6dkzru.streamlit.app/
